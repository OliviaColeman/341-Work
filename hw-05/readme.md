# `Week Five Assignment`

## 1. Summary
* I read the chapters in the book for forms and images.
* I followed the instructions on the class web page.
* I created the html and markdown files.
* I utilized the `Bing` search bar for help with my homework.
* I recently wrote a paper about assisted animal therapy, so I thought it would be neat to create my questionnaire based on another project I had completed for a different class.

## 2. Trials and Triumphs
* I struggled a little bit with adding pictures in `html`.
* I found a useful web page to help explain turning a picture into a link. [WikHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Picture-Link-in-HTML)
* Here is a web page that helped me learn how to make my forms submit to my email. [Click Here](http://www.chami.com/tips/internet/010597I.html)
* I feel like this website is so great for help with coding. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

## 3. Going Forward
* I would like to learn a little more about form attributes. I am still confused on a few things like the `id` attribute.
* I am still looking forward to create a more detailed web page with colors!
