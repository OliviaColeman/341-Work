# `Week Six Assignment`

## 1. Summary


## 2. Trials and Triumphs
* I think I'm doing pretty well with the form elements.
* I feel like I'm still a little confused about which types of elements definitely need an `id` and `class` attribute.
* I am still trying to fully figure out adding videos. I don't really have any of my own videos, so I've had to stick to using YouTube.

## 3. Going Forward
* Looking forward to adding styles and color.
* I feel like it has been hard to contribute to the issues discussion because there aren't a whole lot of posts.
