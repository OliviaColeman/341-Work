        Responsive Web Design (RWD):
      </h1>
      <p>
        RWD is a web design approach that allows a webpage to be viewed differently depending on the user's platform, screen size, and orientation.

        Why Utilize RWD?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Responsive Web Design is important.
        When a user switches platforms (ex: computer to cellphone), the webpage that they were viewing should be able to accomodate the new platform.
        Instead of relying on countless custom-made solutions for every website and every device, we can make the design automatically adjust.
        Today, technology gives us a wider variety of gadgets and platforms, and new ones are always being created.
        With RWD, we can make sure that the new technologies are compatible with our designs.

      <p>
        The main elements in Responsive Web Design are: flexible grid based layout, flexible media, and media queries.
        Flexible grid based layouts use breakpoints to tell the site how to layer it's content to fit different device widths.
        The layouts are broken down into columns and rows for easy positioning.
        Flexbox allows the columns and rows to be rearranged as the width changes.
        You can also use flexbox to order your elements.
        This can be useful if you would like the element order to change depending on the device width.
        Flexible media allows you to scale your images or other media depending on the device width.
        If you do not want to shrink the media, you can add scroll bars.
        Media queries are used to create different style rules for every specified device width called breakpoints.
        For example: if a device is 450px or under in width, you would create a query for a layout with 450px as the max-width.
        The site will look differently when viewd at 450px compared to 1200px, because you created a separate style for this query.
        It helps to use a separate style sheet for each query.
        This way, every device width can be styled differently.
