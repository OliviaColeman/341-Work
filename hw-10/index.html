        Responsive Web Design (RWD):
      </h1>
      <p>
        RWD is a web design approach that allows a webpage to be viewed differently depending on the user's platform, screen size, and orientation.

        Why Utilize RWD?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Responsive Web Design is important.
        When a user switches platforms (ex: computer to cellphone), the webpage that they were viewing should be able to accomodate the new platform.
        Instead of relying on countless custom-made solutions for every website and every device, we can make the design automatically adjust.
        Today, technology gives us a wider variety of gadgets and platforms, and new ones are always being created.
        With RWD, we can make sure that the new technologies are compatible with our designs.
