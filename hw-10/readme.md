# `Week Ten Assignment`

## 1. Summary

## 2. Trials and Triumphs
* I would recommend for anyone using Firefox as a browser to download the Web Developer extension. You can view the web page in Responsive Design Mode, and view the screen width. You can also toggle the width to see how the website changes.
* This week's information was hard for me to fully understand everything. I found it hard to talk about RWD because I do not fully understand it myself. It is hard for me to explain. Some subjects I understood, others I do not.
* It took me a while to figure out how to make the image resize with the device-width.

## 3. Going Forward
* I am super nervous about creating my final website. I am worried about how much time we will get to create it. 

## 4. Resources
