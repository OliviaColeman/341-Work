# `Week three Assignment`

## 1. Summary
* I read the chapters in the book about creating my first web page, and followed along with the instructions on our class website.
* I learned about tags and elements, such as `<html>`, `<body>`, and `</body>`.
* I changed my GitHub page to "go live" so that anyone can see my first web page.
* I created my first web page with one of my favorite poems included.
* I created this readme file in Atom for the second part of the homework.

## 2. Trials and Triumphs
* I learned **not** to make the mistake of using `<p/>` instead of `</p>`
* I think I finally got the hang of committing files to my GitHub account.
* I learned how to add emojis to markdown files for the fun of it. :smiley: :lollipop:

## 3. Going forward
* I am excited to learn more about creating web pages, adding colors and styles, and hopefully more images.
* I feel like what I learned this week was great, and a big step towards creating better documents and designing web pages.

## 4. Class Issues
* I was able to respond to an issue this week, I hope to be able to contribute more to the class in the future.
