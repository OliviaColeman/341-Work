# `Week Nine Assignment`

## 1. Summary
* I created all the folders and documents first.
* Then I created the header with the dropdown menu and logo for all the pages of the site.
* I added links to different sites that go along with the subject. I used the box model to style the links.
* Then I added pictures and content.
* I used google fonts to style the text for the entire site.
* For the color scheme I used red, grey, black, and green. These colors sort of remind me of zombie colors, so that is why I chose them. And they work really well together.
* I used `float:` to create the layout with the side menu and main content boxes.
* I used `display: block` and `z-index:` for the dropdown menu.
* I used `position: static` in my `<h3>` headers.
* I used `position: relative` in my unordered list.

## 2. Trial and Triumphs
* It took me a really long time to get the dropdown menu working and the layout to look correctly on all the pages. The boxes kept moving around.
* I am having some problems with Github showing my pictures.
* I feel like I have the box model down pretty well now.

## 3. Going Forward
* I am looking forward to perfecting my styling more.
* I think it would be helpful if there were more examples of the code on the website and how to use it. Sometimes the example pictures do not show for me, and the code can get confusing.
