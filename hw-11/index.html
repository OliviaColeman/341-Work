      <h3>Basic Information About Mushrooms</h3>
      <p>
        Mushrooms are fungi.
        They do not contain clorophyll, which is what plants use to manufacure food and energy.
        Mushrooms break down non-living organic matter as a food source.
        A mushroom's typical life span ranges between one day to one week, depending on the type of fungi.
        Sometimes they last less than 24 hours.
        The fungus material is called mycelium.
        Mycelium is made out of countless little filaments woven together.
        These filaments are called hyphae.
        The hyphae secrete the enzymes that break down the organic material.
        Mushrooms produce spores instead of seeds.
        The spores are microscopic single cells that are protected by a layer of chitin.

          “When the mushrooms took hold she sensed some of the gods calling to her from inside her own chest and followed their urging outside into the yard and up the sunny slope into the trees.
          She felt all gooey, gooey with the slobbered love of various gods gathered within, and smiling full-time went about the woods looking to collect butterflies and pet them until they gave milk, or maybe roll in the dirt until she felt China through her skin.”
          <br />
