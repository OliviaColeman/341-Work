# `Week Eleven Assignment`

## 1. Summary
* I first created my files and folders.
* Then I decided on a topic and looked for pictures that would work well.
* I made sure the layout worked before I started adding text.
* I added some links for more information to keep the site short.
* Then I used Google Fonts for a font type.

## 2. Trials and Triumphs
* I had to place my images folder in the CSS folder for the images to show.
* It was difficult at first to find images that would work well for the full screen background.
* I feel like the site turned out better than I had expected.

## 3. Going Forward
* I can't believe how much I have learned so far! I can't wait to apply my skills in my career.
